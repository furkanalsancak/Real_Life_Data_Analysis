#Real-Life Data Analysis Repository

##Overview
Welcome to the Real-Life Data Analysis repository! This collection of data analysis projects explores various aspects of real life data. Each folder in this repository represents a different domain, providing real-world datasets for analysis. The goal is to prepare for real life scenarios, and understand how businesses, or companies would want to derive insights from diverse datasets.

Project Structure
The repository is structured into three main folders, each corresponding to a specific domain:

- /Company_Sales_Data
  - company_sales_data.csv
  - company_sales_data_analysis.ipynb
- /Inventory_Price
  - data.csv
  - inventory_price_complete.py
- /Plane_Prices_Data
  - new_names.csv
  - Plane_Price.csv
  - plane_prices_csv.py
- README.md
Company_Sales_Data: Contains datasets related to company sales, accompanied by an analysis notebook (analysis.ipynb) detailing insights and visualizations.

Inventory_Price: Focuses on inventory price data, with a python file, containing the code for the analysis.

Plane_Prices_Data: Holds datasets concerning plane prices, along with a python file for code of the analysis.


##Data Sources
The datasets used in these projects are included within their respective folders (data.csv). These datasets are sourced from real-world scenarios (pulled from Kaggle.com), providing authentic data for analysis.
